A simple 3D fishing simulation game that I created for my university thesis using Unity 3D. The game aims to present endemic fish species in Indonesia. By fishing in this game, you can learn about the various fish species found in Indonesian waters.

The game is currently available for Windows. You can check it out on my itch.io page:
